# capnpc-dart
This compiler compiles capnp files to be used in dart projects. 
As described by robo fiddle below, the compile generates output that makes the capnp-dart package usable. 

Compile the rust project with cargo build --release- this is to create the compiler which you will use to create the capnp files. 
Don't alter the files produced by this compiler.
